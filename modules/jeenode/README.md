This is custom Sensor unit handler used to capture plenty of metrics and send them over the air to central server.

The unit module is built and inspired from JeeLab Room node. 

Transmit uses RFM12/RFM69CW to transmit over 868 Mhz.

Sensors are placed in each room and are each monitoring few of below:
* Temparature (1 or more sensor per unit)
* Humidity
* Pressure
* Light
* TODO: plant humidity
* TODO: gaz
* TODO: pH-meter / CO2

Eventualy, the various measure will serve for:
* control electric heaters
* control VMC (home motorized air flow controler)
* alarms on various actions (plants, etc)
